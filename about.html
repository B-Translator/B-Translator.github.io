<h2>What is B-Translator</h2>

<p>The codename <b>B-Translator</b> can be decoded like <b>Bee
Translator</b>, since it aims at collecting very small translation
contributions from a wide crowd of people and to dilute them into
something useful. It can also be decoded like <b>Be Translator</b>, as
an invitation to anybody to give his small contribution for
translating programs or making their translations better.</p>

<h2>The goals of the project</h2>

<p>This software helps to get feedback about l10n (translations of the
programs). It also helps to unify all the different translations and
to ensure consistency among the translations.</p>

<p>The motivation for developing such a software is that the
traditional (current) l10n workflow requires highly dedicated people,
and does not allow (or at least does not facilitate) small
contributions from random people that do not have such a high
dedication, determination and enough free time.</p>

<p>Also, the process of reviewing and correcting translations is not
easy and does not facilitate the feedback from the users of the
translated programs. Although the translators are usually very good
and professional, they can make mistakes too, and sometimes they may
miss the best translation for some certain terms. Some feedback from
the crowd of the users would be more than welcome, if there are tools
to collect and facilitate it.</p>

<p>Another problem with translations is that sometimes they are not
consistent. The same string has different translations in different
programs, and sometimes even the same translator may have provided
different translations for the same string in different cases.</p>

<p>To summarize, the problems that this software tries to solve are
these:
<ul>
  <li>Merging translations from different sources (for example
      translations made on Launchpad and those made on KDE or
      GNOME).</li>
  <li>Helping to ensure consistency among the translations.</li>
  <li>Getting feedback about the translations from a wide crowd of
      people and users. This feedback can be in terms of votes for the
      best translation (when there are more than one translations for
      the same string), or it can be a new alternative translation
      (for an existing translation), or it can be a new translation
      suggestion (for a string that is not translated yet).</li>
</ul>
