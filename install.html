<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>B-Translator is made of two parts, a client application and a
server application, which communicate with each-other through an HTTP
API. They can be installed together on the same server, or they can be
installed on different servers. Both of these applications are built
with Drupal7. For more flexibility, there is also a drupal module for
the client, that can be installed independently on any Drupal
application or distribution.</p>

<h3>Installing B-Translator Client</h3>

<p>The recommended way of installation for a production server is to
install it inside a chroot, in <em>trusty</em> (ubuntu
14.04). Assuming that we have already installed a minimal ubuntu
server 14.04 (trusty), B-Translator Client can be installed in it like
this:
<pre class="example">mkdir /var/chroot
cd /var/chroot/
git clone https://github.com/B-Translator/btr_client.git
cp btr_client/install/settings.sh bcl.sh
vim bcl.sh
nohup nice btr_client/install/chroot.sh bcl.sh &
tail -f nohup.out
less -r nohup.out</pre>
</p>

<p>This will install in <code>/var/chroot/</code> a minimal ubuntu
system, B-Translator Client, and everything that is needed for the
normal work of the system. It will also make the neccessary common
configurations of the system.</p>

<p>The installation script will also create the init script
<code>/etc/init.d/chroot-bcl</code>, which can be used to start and
stop the services inside the chroot:
<pre class="example">service chroot-bcl start
service chroot-bcl stop</pre>
</p>

<h3>Installing B-Translator Server</h3>

<p>The recommended way of installation for a production server is to
install it inside a chroot, in <em>trusty</em> (ubuntu
14.04). Assuming that we have already installed a minimal ubuntu
server 14.04 (trusty), B-Translator Server can be installed in it like
this:
<pre class="example">mkdir /var/chroot
cd /var/chroot/
git clone https://github.com/B-Translator/btr_client.git
git clone https://github.com/B-Translator/btr_server.git
cp btr_server/install/settings.sh btr.sh
vim btr.sh
nohup nice btr_server/install/chroot.sh btr.sh &
tail -f nohup.out
less -r nohup.out</pre>
</p>

<p>This will install in <code>/var/chroot/</code> a minimal ubuntu
system, B-Translator Server, B-Translator Client, and everything that
is needed for the normal work of the system. It will also make the
neccessary common configurations of the system.</p>

<p>The installation script will also create the init script
<code>/etc/init.d/chroot-btr</code>, which can be used to start and
stop the services inside the chroot:
<pre class="example">service chroot-btr start
service chroot-btr stop</pre>
</p>
