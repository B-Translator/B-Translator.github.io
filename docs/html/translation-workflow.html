<h2 id="sec-1">Translation files </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
The translation files that are imported into the DB are retrieved
from the repository of the corresponding projects. This is done by
the scripts in the directory <code>get/</code>, which checkout (or update)
these files from each projects' repository.
</p>
<p>
The way of getting these files is slightly different for different
projects. However all of them are placed in the directory
<code>$data_root</code>, which is defined in <code>config.sh</code>. Besides <code>$data_root</code>,
<code>config.sh</code> defines also the variable <code>$languages</code>, which is a list
of the codes of the languages that are supported by the system.
</p>
<p>
Projects on the <code>$data_root</code> are also grouped (categorized) by
origin.  For example all the GNOME projects are placed on the same
directory, all the KDE projects on another directory, and so on.
Under the 'origin' directory, there is a subdirectory for each
language, and under it usually there is a subdirectory for each
project, containing all the translation files of the project, in
any structure that is suitable for the project.
</p>
<p>
Some projects have just a single translation (PO) file (for example
those of GNOME or ubuntu), some others have several translation
files (like those of KDE), and some others have many translation
files (like those of LibreOffice and Mozilla).
</p>
<p>
In the case of Mozilla, translation files are not in gettext format,
so they are converted to PO files using <code>moz2po</code> (from Translation
Toolkit).
</p>

</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Importing </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
Translation files are imported into the database by the scripts in
the directory <code>import/</code>.
</p>
<p>
Importing is done in two steps: the first step is to import the
template (POT) files of the project, and the second step is to
import the translation (PO) files for each language.  A POT file
usually has a corresponding PO file for each language.
</p>
<p>
The template (POT) files contain the translatable strings of the
project, with empty translations (this is why they are called
templates). The translation (PO) files contain the same strings
as the POT files, but with the corresponding translations for a
certain language. In the import scripts, usually the French (fr)
translation files are used as template files.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2.1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2.1">Importing template files (pot_import.php) </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2.1">


<p>
Template files are imported by <code>pot_import.php</code>, which is called
like this:
</p>


<pre class="example">$ ./pot_import.php

Usage: ./pot_import.php origin project tplname file.pot
  origin   -- The origin of the project (ubuntu, GNOME, KDE, LibreOffice, etc.)
  project  -- The name of the project that is being imported.
  tplname  -- The name of the PO template.
  file.pot -- The POT file of the project.

Examples:
  ./pot_import.php KDE kdeedu kturtle test/kturtle.pot
  ./pot_import.php KDE kdeedu kturtle test/kturtle_fr.po

</pre>




<p>
<code>pot_import.php</code> creates a new template and a new project (if
needed).  If the given <span style="text-decoration:underline;">origin+project</span> already exists, then the
existing project is used.  However, if the given template already
exists (for this project), then it is deleted first (along with the
locations and files related to it), and then recreated.
</p>
<p>
Along with the template, locations that are contained in this
template are created as well. The string corresponding to each
location is created only if it does not already exist. Otherwise
the existing string is referenced instead (and the reference count
of the string is incremented).
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2.2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2.2">Importing translation files (po_import.php) </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2.2">


<p>
Translation files are imported by <code>po_import.php</code>, which is called
like this:
</p>


<pre class="example">$ ./po_import.php

Usage: ./po_import.php origin project tplname lng file.po
  origin  -- The origin of the project (ubuntu, GNOME, KDE, LibreOffice, etc.)
  project -- The name of the project.
  tplname -- The name of the PO template.
  lng     -- The language of translation (de, fr, sq, en_GB, etc.).
  file.po -- The PO file to be imported.

Example:
  ./po_import.php KDE kdeedu kturtle fr test/kturtle.po

</pre>




<p>
<code>po_import.php</code> imports a new PO (translation) file.  It assumes
that the POT file of the project has already been imported,
otherwise it will quit without doing anything.  If the file has
been already imported, then it is skiped.
</p>
<p>
For each file, all the information that is needed for exporting it
is stored, like the file name and path, the headers of the file,
the content of the file, etc.
</p>
<p>
Along with the file, it also inserts the translations for the
corresponding strings, when such translations do not exist.
</p>

</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2.3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2.3">Import example (pingus.sh) </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2.3">


<p>
The most simple example of importing a project is <code>pingus.sh</code>. The
other scripts import many projects from the same origin at once,
and have logic about getting the project name, finding the files,
etc. Also, they may have several (or many) template files for each
project, which makes the logic even more complex.
</p>
<p>
The basic import code of <code>pingus.sh</code> is this:
</p>


<pre class="example">### make last snapshots before re-import
make-last-snapshot $origin $project fr
make-last-snapshot $origin $project sq

### import the template
potemplate=pingus
./pot_import.php $origin $project $potemplate $po_dir/pingus-fr.po

### import the PO files
./po_import.php $origin $project $potemplate fr $po_dir/pingus-fr.po
./po_import.php $origin $project $potemplate sq $po_dir/pingus-sq.po

## make initial snapshots after (re)import
make-snapshot $origin $project fr $po_dir/pingus-fr.po
make-snapshot $origin $project sq $po_dir/pingus-sq.po
</pre>




<p>
The main import code is: importing first the template, and then
importing the translation file for each language. However, before
the import we <i>make a last snapshot</i> of the existing project, and
after the import we also <i>make a snapshot</i>. These two functions,
<code>make-last-snapshot</code> and <code>make-snapshot</code> are defined on
<code>make-snapshot.sh</code>, which is included in <code>pingus.sh</code>. They will be
discussed in more details in the section about the snapshots and
diffs.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2.4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2.4">Import scripts </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2.4">


<p>
The other scripts in the directory import are used to import
projects from a certain origin. For example <code>kde.sh</code> imports (or
re-imports) all the KDE projects, <code>office.sh</code> imports/re-imports
all the LibreOffice projects, and so on.
</p>
<p>
If a list of projects is passed on the command-line to these
scripts, then only the specified projects will be imported (instead
of all the projects.)

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Exporting </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
As we have seen, besides the strings and translations, the import of
PO files saves also the structure of these files and all the
relevant data that are needed to export them again from the DB.
</p>
<p>
Export scripts are in the directory <code>export/</code>.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.1">Exporting PO files (po_export.php) </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.1">


<p>
The script <code>po_export.php</code> is used to export a single PO file. It
is used like this:
</p>


<pre class="example">$ ./po_export.php

Usage: ./po_export.php origin project tplname lng [file.po [export_mode]]
  origin      -- the origin of the project (ubuntu, GNOME, KDE, etc.)
  project     -- the name of the project to be exported
  tplname     -- The name of the PO template.
  lng         -- translation to be exported (de, fr, sq, en_GB, etc.)
  file.po     -- output file (stdout if not given)
  export_mode -- 'most_voted' (default) or 'original'

The export mode 'most_voted' (which is the default one) exports the
most voted translations and suggestions.
The export mode 'original' exports the translations of the original
file that was imported (useful for making an initial snapshot of
the project).
If the export mode is not given as an argument, then the env variable
PO_EXPORT_MODE will be tried.

Examples:
  ./po_export.php KDE kdeedu kturtle fr &gt; test/kturtle_fr.po
  ./po_export.php KDE kdeedu kturtle fr test/kturtle_fr.po original

</pre>




<p>
The PO file to be exported is identified by <code>{origin, project,    tplname, lng}</code>.
</p>
<p>
If the export mode is <i>original</i>, then the same translations that
were imported are exported again. This is useful for making initial
snapshots and diffs, which we will discuss later. However it should
be noted that the exported file is not exctly the same as the
imported file.  One reason is that the formating can be different,
although the strings and translations are the same. Another reason
is that during import some entries are skiped. like
'translator-credits' etc.
</p>
<p>
If the export mode is <i>most_voted</i>, and some of the translations
have been voted, then the most voted translation is exported
instead. This is how the input/feedback of the reviewers is
transfered into the PO files. But since the formatting of the
exported file is not exactly the same as the imported file, this
exported file cannot be used directly to be commited to the project
repository. Instead it is merged somehow with the existing PO file
of the project. This merge can be simply done by <code>msgmerge</code>, or by
tools like <code>lokalize</code> that facilitate merging of PO files. Another
option is to get the differencies between the exported file and the
original file and to apply them to the current PO file.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.2">Exporting projects (export.sh) </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.2">


<p>
To export all the PO files of a project, the script <code>export.sh</code> is
used:
</p>


<pre class="example">$ ./export.sh
Usage: ./export.sh origin project lng output_dir
</pre>




<p>
If <code>project==all</code>, then all the projects of the given origin will be
exported. It the environments variable QUIET is defined, then it
will be less verbose (will not output much progress/debug info).
</p>
<p>
The exported files are saved under the directory <code>output_dir</code>.
Their path under the <code>output_dir</code> is the same as the path of the
imported files. This is useful for making diffs with the original
files of the project.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.3">Exporting projects in tgz format (export_tgz.sh) </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.3">


<p>
This script is usually called from the web (through the REST API)
to export all the PO files of a project, in .tgz format.
</p>


<pre class="example">$ ./export_tgz.sh
Usage: ./export_tgz.sh origin project lng [output_dir]
</pre>




<p>
If project==all, then all the projects of the given origin will be
exported. If the <code>output_dir</code> is not given, then the <code>/tmp</code>
directory will be used.
</p>
<p>
It outputs the path of the created archive.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Snapshots and diffs </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
A <i>snapshot</i> is an export from the DB of the current PO files of a
project-language. This export (which is a .tgz archive) is stored in
the DB. A project has a snapshot for each language. Snapshots are
useful for generating the <i>diffs</i>.
</p>
<p>
A <i>diff</i> is the difference between the snapshot and the previous
snapshot.  The diffs are stored in the DB as well. They are
sequentially numbered and keep the history of changes.
</p>
<p>
There are two types of diffs that are generated and stored. One is
the <i>unified diff</i> (<code>diff -u</code>) and the other the <i>embedded diff</i>
(generated by pology
<a href="http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/l10n-support/pology/">http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/l10n-support/pology/</a>)
</p>
<p>
Diffs ensure that translators get only the latest feedback (since
the last snapshot), without having to review again the suggestions
made previously. So, they make easier the work of the translators.
However the previous diffs are saved in the DB as well, in order to
have a full history of the suggested translations over the time.

<h3 id="sec-4.1">Keeping diffs in the DB (db_diff.php) </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4.1">


<p>
The script <code>db_diff.php</code> is used to <i>add</i>, <i>list</i> or <i>get</i> the diffs
from the DB. It is just an interface to the DB.
</p>



<pre class="example">$ ./db_diff.php

Usage: ./db_diff.php add  origin project lng file.diff file.ediff [comment [user_id]]
       ./db_diff.php list origin project lng
       ./db_diff.php get  origin project lng number (diff|ediff) [file]

  origin     -- the origin of the project (ubuntu, GNOME, KDE, etc.)
  project    -- the name of the project to be exported
  lng        -- language of translation (de, fr, sq, en_GB, etc.)
  file.diff  -- file in `diff -u` format
  file.ediff -- file in ediff (embedded diff) format
  comment    -- optional comment about the ediff file that is being added
  user_id    -- optional (drupal) uid of the user that is adding the ediff
  number     -- the number of ediff that is being retrieved

Examples:
  ./db_diff.php add LibreOffice sw fr LibreOffice-sw-fr.diff LibreOffice-sw-fr.ediff
  ./db_diff.php list LibreOffice sw fr
  ./db_diff.php get LibreOffice sw fr 5 diff &gt; LibO/fr/sw_5.diff

<h3 id="sec-4.2">Keeping snapshots in the DB (db_snapshot.php) </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4.2">


<p>
The script <code>db_snapshot.php</code> is used as a DB interface for the snapshots.
</p>



<pre class="example">$ ./db_snapshot.php

Usage: ./db_snapshot.php (init|update|get) origin project lng file.tgz

  origin   -- the origin of the project (ubuntu, GNOME, KDE, etc.)
  project  -- the name of the project to be exported
  lng      -- language of translation (de, fr, sq, en_GB, etc.)
  file.tgz -- tgz archive of the snapshot of the project

The operation 'init' is used to insert into the DB the snapshot
for the first time. The operation 'update' to update it, and
'get' to retrive it from the DB.

Examples:
  ./db_snapshot.php init   LibreOffice sw fr LibreOffice-sw-fr.tgz
  ./db_snapshot.php update LibreOffice sw fr LibreOffice-sw-fr.tgz
  ./db_snapshot.php get    LibreOffice sw fr LibreOffice-sw-fr.tgz

</pre>




<p>
The operation <code>init</code> will first delete a snapshot, if it already

This script compares the current translation files of an <code>{origin,    project, lng}</code> with the last snapshot.
</p>



<pre class="example">$ ./make_diff.sh

Usage: ./make_diff.sh origin project lng

Export the current state of translation files of a project-language
and make a diff with the last snapshot.

</pre>




<p>
It does these:
</p><ol>
<li>
Export the current files for the given <code>{origin, project, lng}</code>
(by calling <code>export.sh</code>)
</li>
<li>
Get the (last) snapshot for <code>{origin, project, lng}</code>
</li>
<li>
Make the difference between them with <code>diff -rubB</code> and with <code>pology</code>

</li>
</ol>

<p>When it is done, it leaves in its own directory the files
<code>origin-project-lng.tgz</code> (which contains the exported files),
<code>origin-project-lng.diff</code> and <code>origin-project-lng.ediff</code>.
</p>
<p>
It outputs some debug information as well, but if the <code>QUIET</code>
environment variable is define, this output is suppressed.

<pre class="example">$ ./make_snapshot.sh

Usage: ./make_snapshot.sh origin project lng [diff_comment]

Make the diff with the last snapshot and store it in DB.
Save in DB the current snapshot.

</pre>




<p>
This script just calls <code>make_diff.sh</code> and stores in DB the files
<code>origin-project-lng.diff</code> and <code>origin-project-lng.ediff</code>, if they
are not empty. It also updates the snapshot of <code>{origin, project,    lng}</code> with the file <code>origin-project-lng.tgz</code>. Finally it cleans all
the three files generated by <code>make_diff.sh</code>.
</p>
<p>
<code>make_diff.sh</code> is separated from <code>make_snapshot.sh</code> because it
needs to be used also by the REST API
<code>translations/project/diff/origin/project/lng/-</code> to generate the
changes (diffs) since the last snapshot.

<div id="outline-container-4.5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4.5">Lifecycle of the diffs and snapshots </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4.5">


<p>
When a project is imported, an initial snapshot is created and
stored in the DB as well. This initial snapshot contains the
original files that were used for the import. It is done like this:
</p>


<pre class="example">### store the tgz file into the DB as a snapshot
../export/db_snapshot.php init $origin $project $lng $snapshot_tgz
</pre>




<p>
Immediately after the initial snapshot, another snapshot is done,
by exporting files in the <i>original</i> mode.
</p>


<pre class="example">### make a second snapshot, which will generate a diff
### with the initial snapshot, and will save it into the DB
export PO_EXPORT_MODE='original'   ## set the export mode for po_export.php
diff_comment="Import diff. Contains formating changes, any skiped entries, etc."
../export/make_snapshot.sh $origin $project $lng "$diff_comment"
</pre>



<p>
This snapshot will also generate a diff, which contains the
differences that come as a result of formating changes between the
original format and the exported format. It also contains the
entries that are skipped during the import.
</p>
<p>
Whenever a translator checks the latest diff, he should also make a
snapshot, which will also generate the diff with the previous
snapshot (and store it on the DB). As a result, the translations
that have been already suggested to him will not be suggested
again.
</p>
<p>
When the time comes to re-import a project, a last snapshot is made
automatically before the import, in order to store as a diff any
latest (unchecked) suggestions.
</p>


<pre class="example">### make a last snapshot before the import (useful in the case of re-import)
export PO_EXPORT_MODE='most_voted'   ## set the export mode for po_export.php
diff_comment="Contains the latest suggestions before import."
../export/make_snapshot.sh $origin $project $lng "$diff_comment"
</pre>




<p>
Then an initial snapshot is made again with the original files,
using <code>db_snapshot.php init ...</code> (which will not generate any
diff).  After it, a snapshot using the <code>original</code> mode of export is
made again, which will generate again any formating changes and
save them as a diff.
</p>
<p>
However, in the case of re-import, another snapshot is needed,
using the <code>most_voted</code> mode of export, which will generate a diff
that contains all the feedback and suggestions made before the
re-import.

<pre class="example">### make another snapshot, which will contain all the previous suggestions
### (before the import), in a single diff
export PO_EXPORT_MODE='most_voted'   ## set the export mode for po_export.php

<p>
Usually this diff contains the suggestions that the translator has
already rejected, and making this snapshot ensures that they are
not suggested again to him.
</p>
<p>
This logic of the initial snapshots and diffs is applied by calling
the functions <code>make-last-snapshot()</code> and <code>make-snapshot()</code>, which
are defined on the file <code>import/make-snapshot.sh</code>. They are
included and called automatically by the import scripts, before and
after each import.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4.6">


<p>
This script can be used by the translators to get the diffs of the
projects from the server, through the REST API.
</p>



<pre class="example">$ ./wget-diffs.sh

Usage: ./wget-diffs.sh origin project lng [nr]

    Get the diffs of a project using wget and the REST API.
    If 'nr' is missing, then the list of diffs will be retrieved instead.
    If 'nr' is '-', then the latest diffs (since the last snapshot)
    will be computed and returned (it will take longer to execute, since
    the diffs are calculated on the fly).

Examples:
    ./wget-diffs.sh KDE kdelibs sq
    ./wget-diffs.sh KDE kdelibs sq 1
    ./wget-diffs.sh KDE kdelibs sq 2
    ./wget-diffs.sh KDE kdelibs sq -

<p>
The files <code>*.db.php</code> contain DB clases that encapsulate the
interaction of import/export scripts with the database of the
application. All of them extend <code>db/class.DB.php</code>, which creates a
connection to the database. The paramaters of the DB connection are
included from <code>db/settings.php</code>, which is generated automatically
during installation.

<p>
<code>gettext/POParser.php</code> is a parser used to extract the data from a
PO/POT file, in order to import them into the DB . It is taken from:
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/php-po-parser/issues/detail?id=2">http://code.google.com/p/php-po-parser/issues/detail?id=2</a> It makes
no validity checks, but this is OK, since the PO files that are
imported are supposed to be valid. (Anyway, if needed, PO files can
be checked with msgfmt before being imported).
</p>
<p>
<code>gettext/POWriter.php</code> is used during export to generate a PO file
from the projects, locations, strings and translatins that are
stored in the DB.
