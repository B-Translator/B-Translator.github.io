<h2 id="sec-1">The goals of the project </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
This software helps to get feedback about l10n (translations of the
programs). It also helps to unify all the different translations and
to ensure consistency among the translations. It is intended to be
used for the translations of programs into Albanian, but it can be
used for any other languages as well.
</p>
<p>
The motivation for developing such a software is that the
traditional (current) l10n workflow requires highly dedicated
people, and does not allow (or at least does not facilitate) small
contributions from random people that do not have such a high
dedication, determination and enough free time.
</p>
<p>
Also, the process of reviewing and correcting translations is not
easy and does not facilitate the feedback from the users of the
translated programs. Although the translators are usually very good
and professional, they can make mistakes too, and sometimes they may
miss the best translation for some certain terms. Some feedback from
the crowd of the users would be more than welcome, if there are
tools to collect and facilitate it.
</p>
<p>
Another problem with translations is that sometimes they are not
consistent. The same string has different translations in different
programs, and sometimes even the same translator may have provided
different translations for the same string in different cases. This
happens mainly because each program/project has its own translations
and there is no central repository for all the translations.
</p>
<p>
To summarize, the problems that this software tries to solve are
these:
</p><ul>
<li>
Getting feedback about the translations from a wide crowd of
people and users. This feedback can be in terms of votes for the
best translation (when there are more than one translations for
the same string), or it can be a new alternative translation (for
an existing translation), or it can be a new translation
suggestion (for a string that is not translated yet).
</li>
<li>
Helping to ensure consistency among the translations.
</li>
<li>
Merging translations from different sources (for example
translations made on Launchpad and those made on KDE or GNOME).


</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sec-2">What means B-Translator </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
The codename <b>B-Translator</b> can be decoded like <b>Bee Translator</b>,
since it aims at collecting very small translation contributions
from a wide crowd of people and to dilute them into something
useful.
</p>
<p>
It can also be decoded like <b>Be Translator</b>, as an invitation to
anybody to give his small contribution for translating programs or
making their translations better.
</p>
<p>
If you could come up with some other interesting explanations,
please let me know.

<h2 id="sec-3">How it works </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">



</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.1">Build a dictionary of l10n strings </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.1">


<p>
The source of the translation data used by the software are the
POT/PO files of the projects.  The PO template files (POT) contain
the list of translatable strings of a project (in English), and the
PO translation files contain the strings and the corresponding
translations for a certain language.  (More information and details
about PO/POT formats and the translation process is provided by
`info gettext`.)
</p>
<p>
These PO files are imported into the DB of the software. This
import creates a dictionary of strings and their corresponding
translations. The same string can be used in more than one
projects, but in the dictionary it is stored only once. However, if
the same string has different translations in several projects, all
of the distinct translations will be stored into the DB.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.2">Collect feedback from users/reviewers </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.2">


<p>
These strings and the corresponding translations are presented for
review to a large community of reviewers/users. The reviewers
indicate which translation they think is the best by voting for it.
They can also suggest any new translations (or suggest translations
for strings that are yet un-translated). These new translations and
the votes/likes of the reviewers are stored in the DB as well
</p>
<p>
The review process happens slowly and gradually during a long
time. We can assume that each reviewer checks only one string each
day, and that there is a very large number of reviewers that give
feedback each day. The feedback can be collected through different
channels, like web interface, social networks (Facebook,
Google+, Twitter), email, mobile apps, etc.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.3">Export the revised translations </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.3">


<p>
Besides the dictionary of strings and translations, the import of
PO files saves also the structure of these files and all the
relevant data that are needed to export them again from the
DB. However, during the export of the PO files, the most voted
translations for each string are retrieved from the DB, instead of
the original translations that were imported. This is how the
input/feedback of the reviewers is transfered into the PO
files. These exported PO files can then be uploded/commited into
the repositories of the corresponding projects.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.4">The process/workflow for a project without translation </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.4">


<p>
According to the steps decsribed above, the process/workflow for a
project that has no translation yet, would be like this:
</p><ol>
<li>
Checkout POT files from the repository of the project.
</li>
<li>
Import them into the DB.
</li>
<li>
Over some time, collect translation suggestions from the users.
These translations can also be reviewed and evaluated by other
users.
</li>
<li>
Export the PO files from the DB.
</li>
<li>
Review, fix and reformat them as needed.
</li>
<li>
Upload/commit the PO files into the repository of the project.
</li>
<li>
When a new POT file is released, start over again from the
begining (but this time we also import the PO file, besides the
POT file).

</li>
</ol>

<p>This process works well if there are no traditional translators to
the project, and there is no other translation workflow happening
concurrently (in parallel) with this one. Otherwise there would be
a need to integrate these two workflows so that they don't override
each-other.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.5">Exporting only the latest suggestions (diffs) </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.5">


<p>
In practice actually there is an existing translation workflow for
almost all the projects. This translation is done either by using a
Pootle system or by using PO editors. So, it is important that our
workflow integrates with this existing workflow.
</p>
<p>
This integration is helped by exporting diffs instead of exporting
PO files. These diffs are retrieved by the maintainers of the
existing translation workflow (translators), and they contain the
latest translation suggestions made by the reviewers through the
feedback system. Such diffs can then be easily checked by the
translators, and if they find them appropriate they can apply them
to the PO files on the existing workflow.
</p>
<p>
Diffs are made between the current state of translations and the
last snapshot of the translations. This ensures that diffs do not
contain any suggestions that have been included already in the
previous diffs, and so making more easy the work of the
translators. The translator is usually interested only on the last
diff, however the previous diffs are saved in the DB as well, in
order to have a full history of the suggested translations over the
time. Whenever a translator checks the latest diff, he should also
make a snapshot, so that the translations that have been already
suggested to him are not suggested again. Making a snapshot will
also generate the diff with the previous snapshot and store this
diff on the DB as well.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3.6">The process/workflow for an integrated translation </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.6">


<p>
The process/workflow for the case when the feedback provided by the
system is integrated in the mainstream translation workflow is like
this:
</p><ol>
<li>
Checkout the latest version of the POT and PO files from the
repository of the project.
</li>
<li>
Import POT files and PO files into the DB.
</li>
<li>
Over some time, collect votes and new translation suggestions
from the users.
</li>
<li>
Time after time (for example each month), the mainstream
translator checks out the last diffs, containing the latest
suggestions (and makes a snapshot as well).
</li>
<li>
The translator reviews the latest suggestions and applies them
in the mainstream translation, if he finds them appropriate.
</li>
<li>
Periodically (for example once or twice a year) go back to steps
(1) and (2) and import the POT and PO files again. This
re-import may introduce new strings and translaions, but will
not affect the existing strings, translations and votes.


</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Functional requirements </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">



</div>

<div id="outline-container-4.1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4.1">Open access </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4.1">


<p>
Everybody should be able to use the system for the purpose of
getting translation suggestions for a certain string, even
unauthenticated (anonymous/guest) users.  Furthermore, it should be
possible to use an API (web services), so that these suggestions
can be retrieved and used even by external applications.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4.2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4.2">Authenticated voting </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4.2">


<p>
Submitting votes or new suggestions will be allowed only for the
subscribed users (which have agreed to help and contribute). No
contributions from anonymous/guests will be accepted.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4.3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4.3">Tracking votes </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4.3">


<p>
Votes and suggestions will not be anonymous. For each vote or
suggestion, the user who submitted it will be recorded and
saved. This will allow the user to see all the strings that he has
already voted for, and also to change any of the votes, if he later
changed his mind. At the same time it will prevent multiple votes
by the same user for the same translation.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4.4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4.4">Highly customizable </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4.4">


<p>
The system will have a flexible configuration and customization
page. This means that the user should be able to customize how much
he would like to help and contribute. For example:
</p><ul>
<li>
how many translation votes per day (an upper limit)
</li>
<li>
which communication means he preferes (email, facebook, google+,
twitter, website, android app, iPhone app, etc.)
</li>
<li>
which projects or packages he would like to focus on (for
example, if the user selects the package KDE, only strings that
belong to a project on this package will be sent to him for
review and feedback)
</li>
<li>
which languages he would like to use as primary and secondary
source languages (for example a user that is not confident in
English, may choose to use French as a primary language and
Italian+Spanish as secondary/helper languages)
</li>
<li>
sequential or random selection of strings (random is the
default, but if the user is interested in just one or a few
projects, he may prefer to review the strings sequentially)

</li>
</ul>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4.5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4.5">Evaluation algorithms </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4.5">


<p>
The contribution and performance of the users should be measured
and evaluated using certain algorithms and/or heuristics. The users
will be awarded points based on their performance. Probably some
rewarding mechanizms can be integrated later for the top
contributers.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4.6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4.6">Detailed and comprehensive reporting and statistics </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4.6">


<p>
Different kinds of reports and statistics related to users,
projects, activity etc. should be supported and provided.
(What are exactly these reports? To be elaborated.)
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4.7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4.7">Integration with the existing workflow of the project translations </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4.7">


<p>
Project translators will continue to work with their prefered tools
(like Pootle, Lokalize, etc.). They will also continue to use their
prefered workflows (the way that they coordinate their translation
work with each-other and with the project releases).
</p>
<p>
This system should help them to get feedback and possibly any new
suggestions or translations from a big crowd of the
contributers. The system should provide means and tools for easy
integration with the workflow of the project translations.
</p>
<p>
For example, it should allow the translation maintainers to import
their existing translation files (PO files), and to export
translation files that contain the most voted translations, as well
as new suggestions (for translated strings) or new translations
(for untranslated strings). It should also allow them to get the
latest changes (suggestions, translations, etc.) since the last
time that they checked, or since a predefined moment in the past.
</p>
<p>
The latest changes should be exported in a format that is easy to
review, modify and apply (diff or ediff).
